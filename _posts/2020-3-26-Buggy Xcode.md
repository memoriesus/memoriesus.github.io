Yesterday morning I update my Xcode and then I never write code on the Xcode.
And then Open my framework and then started to write code this afternoon.

Yeah for developer the building is successful, most people want to get it.

But when I submit the framework to cocoapods, it rebuilds again and then show the error like that:
![Errors displayed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57557632/77635771-08afce80-6f8e-11ea-866b-da80cc8f05b8.png)

In fact when you compile the code and it has errors, the compile time can show it, but the Xcode never showed the error.

Perhaps it's a bug from a new build system.
Yesterday I update Xcode and then there is a bug from SwiftPM, so buggy.

Hope in 11.4.1 The team of Apple can fix it as soon as possible.
From Xcode11.3 to 11.4 it's nearly two more months, I truly hope it's stable.
And then here I made a decision about programming language.I love Ruby since 2011.

**As a software test engineer I use Ruby as my first choice to write scripts to do repeated tasks in daily work.**

Thank for ![Yukihiro Matsumotoâ€˜s book](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57557632/77637216-4b72a600-6f90-11ea-99ba-fc87ff2ac324.JPG)

And during following chapter I paused to use it in my daily work.
For me programming languages are only tools to solve special issues occuring in our lifetime. Ruby is great, but it cannot
solve my issues absolutely, I don't want to keep more tech stacks to jump for AI project.
Python is great, I hope in someday Django can add some great features from Rails.
