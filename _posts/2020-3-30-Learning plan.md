It's a new startpoint to improve myself.
I ever gave me a limit to pause my step, the next step is TOEFL.
My aim is at least 90 points.
This is my big plan this year, I will make it happen and then do more.

Thank for my parents and sisters, my friends. Your encouragement always gave me power to move forward.
You are my biggest wealth in my life. God blesses you.
